# beam chain

## Overview
The proposed beam chain upgrade is a comprehensive consensus layer upgrade for Ethereum that advances network capabilities across three domains: block production, staking, and cryptography. Beyond its technical improvements, beam chain represents a significant opportunity to eliminate historical technical debt while strengthening Ethereum's social layer through increased client diversity, with several new teams showing interest in building beam clients.
