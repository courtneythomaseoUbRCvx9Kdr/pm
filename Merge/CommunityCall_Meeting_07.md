## Summary

—----------------------------

**Trent** [00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=01s): Welcome everybody to the seventh and final merge community call. Let's see what's happened since the last one quite a bit. Bellatrix obviously happened on the sixth and that's basically the final thing we were waiting on before mainnet merge. Same if there is anything major, why don't you just start and I will make sure this link is right in all the places.

**Tim Beiko** [0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=30s): Sure, yeah so good morning or afternoon everyone. Yeah, currently saying this is gonna be the last of these community calls hopefully under something I went it's really bad with merge. But yeah I think we were safe, that's the last one I guess there's two things that I think are worth highlighting today. The first is that yes we had Bellatrix go live yesterday and we'll have the actual transition happen sometime next week.In order to track that there's a bunch of different websites I have personally been using bordell.wtf to track it. So because we use the
value. we can't have a specific time for when the merge happens but it's roughly looking like. It'll be late on Wednesday since first announcing the actual ttd and merge releases a lot of the execution layer client teams have put out new releases that either fix some bugs or have just some suggested improvements. So if you are writing a node it's worth having one more look at the blog post and seeing if you're on the latest version of your client and if not you can kind of look at the release notes on the client you're using and determine whether you want to upgrade. So this is mostly for the consensus sort of mostly for the execution layer clients.So yes please have a look at the post itself and kind of make that call. And then thirdly, this morning literally minutes before this call we put out another blog post about the test net shutdown, so several months ago we announced that killed Ropsten and Rinkeby are deprecated with the merge and kiln was scheduled to be shut down when the merge happens and so this is what will happen. So sometime next week  that test net will be shut down. Obviously it's kind of, you know, impossible to fully shut down a test net. Anyone can still run a note on it. If they want so by shutdown, what we mean is that the boot nodes run by client and testing teams will be turned off and then infrastructure providers will likely stop supporting that network as well. So you know you can still run a node but it might be much harder and if you're an application or user who just wants a test net to use that's a smooth experience that probably won't be the case on those. So kiln is going to sunset next week and then roxanne and ruffson is scheduled to be shut down by the end of this year and ring could be sometime in the first half of next year. We've heard already from several infrastructure providers that they're gonna stop supporting or kind of gracefully shut down support for Ropsten and Rinkeby so that might also mean just less functionality and stuff like that. So if you're using any of Kiln and Ropsten and Rinkeby . I highly suggest you move to Goerli or Sepolia. Those two are very much intended to be supported long into the future.  Hello to all the mcon people travelling in. It's pretty neat to see the room. They're slowly filling up. Yeah so those are the three things I had.  Yeah I guess actually one last quick last one if you do want to watch the merge happen. EthStakers, Bankless, Ethereum Cat Herders and a bunch of others are organising a community call livestream when the merge
is happening. I believe this will be streamed on the ethereum foundation youtube but they're all the ones kind of hosting this and facilitating this. So i'll try and pull up the link after but yes if you want to watch it happen that's probably gonna be the main place. Yeah that's all I had.

**Trent** [4:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=290s): Yeah there's nothing else that comes to mind. Oh thanks Pooja for the link. 

**Tim Beiko** [4:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=295s): Yeah Double check your EL client versions. If you're using kiln and Ropsten , it could be the time to move away and if you want to watch a live stream, the link that Pooja shared is the right one.

**Trent** [5:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=315s): So yeah this is the time for any questions and if we need to stall while people type them out. Happy to make space for client teams or researchers if they want to mention anything specific. We may have forgotten or anything new that's come up recently, So if you're a client team or someone who would like to make a comment from the research side of things just raise your hand and we can you talk about the latest shadow fork please. yeah I think it went off without a hitch there weren't any issues. Pari is here, he's welcome to give a summary

**Micah Zoltu** [6:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=378s): I don't think perry is here.

**Trent** [6:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=384s): Yeah I don't think there was much beyond that other than it went well. It's a good thing to hear. It seems this might be a pretty short call again if people have questions just put them in the chat. We're not going to be talking this entire time. So We're happy to answer questions if they materialise but we're not going to sit here for an hour. If nobody has any questions or anything. Oh there's someone from emconn can ask a question very teacher's message with

**Tim Beiko** [7:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=440s): Yeah I'll say, you know it's very possible that we see some minor issues when the merge happens. Like you know we saw in Bellatrix. There was  a short drop in participation rates. I think we expect those things to happen and we'll deal with them as they come and yeah like the way a theorem is designed. It's made to operate in very imperfect conditions and so I think, we don't need 100 of nodes to update exactly perfectly for this to work. Obviously we want to get us as high as we can but if we see and I suspect. We'll see some minor issues on the day of you know myself and others will kind of chase those down and make sure they get fixed but yeah we did on Bellatrix and bellatrix is basically back to the pre-bellatrix. We did on the beacon chain and the beacon chains basically like the pre-bellatrix levels of the stations and participation so yeah I am feeling good.

**Trent** [8:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=503s): Yeah I'll also share, given we have a little bit of extra space here check out that link. I just put in the chat. It's a compilation of a bunch of responses from core devs including their summary of their feelings leading up to the merch and you can find out if people are scared in those comments.

**Tim Beiko** [8:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=524s): Okay so there's a good question about exchanges and mining pools and what not and like ensuring user safety during the merge and so for mining pools. It's obviously a bit different because I'm not a pool operator but I suspect what I would do if I was one is something you want to mine all the way up to the last block and you know distribute those rewards. There is some potential for reorg on the last proof of work block until the proof of stake chain has finalised so that might require some just monitoring on the order of minutes and as I understand it  mining pools don't send out payouts instantly they usually bundle them.  So I think if you're a mining pool mining all the way up to the last proof of work block, making sure that the chain has finalised and has come to a consensus on that last proof of work block before sending out your rewards is a smart thing to do . Similarly for an exchange you know exchanges do this every network upgrade but they typically pause withdrawals and deposits just to make sure that the chain has settled. So if again I was operating in exchange I would do this you know shortly before the merge up to the point where it's finalised on the other side and you see that the chain is stable beyond that you know there's nothing that. Mining pools or  exchanges should have to do this, except that's different from what they do in any other network upgrade, which is you know upgrade their nose and monitor the chain stability and once everything is kind of clear then they can reopen  deposits and withdrawals. But yeah during that time there might you know if any issue comes up you'd much rather have deposits of withdrawals halted and then for non-censoring any boost relays. There's an answer in the chat around blocks route uh manifold as well said they were working on one but it's unclear if it's released yet. So there's some links in the chat there. Risks if the hash rate starts to go down so basically if it goes down a little bit not much happens you know the merge just happens later than expected. We reach the terminal total difficulty later over the past handful of days. It's actually gone up a bit so but it might go down in the next couple days. You know so if we reach the merge on like the 17th rather than the 14th we'll do nothing, we'll just wait an extra three days if there was a world where say for whatever reason 50 of the hash rate drops overnight which is very unlikely or you know it's just 10 a day over the next week or something like that. It just makes it that instead of reaching ttd on the 5th or 17 were like you know say a month out, then we could coordinate a ttd override which we did on some of the test nets where we just choose a lower ttd value and put out new client releases with it and that coordination you know choosing the value putting out the releases getting everyone to upgrade usually takes at least a week So it's not worth doing if the hash rate is not dropped enough to delay things by over a week. But if we saw that it's dropped enough to delay things by say a month especially in the case where it dropped below like 50 or something and there's maybe these weird scenarios where there could be a 51 percent attack. If that hash rate came back online.  client teams would probably decide to just change the tpd and do an override but it's not looking like that's what's going to happen. Micah, you have a comment on that ?

**Micah Zoltu** [12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=755s): Yeah just in order for at this point in order for us to be delayed by a month the hash rate of drop by 90 or something right yeah that'd be very significant now because and the closer we get to that date the more it has to drop so like tomorrow it'll have to drop 95 or something.

**Tim Beiko** [12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=770s): 
yeah that's right that's right yeah given over like five days away or something it would have to drop. Do you think there will be a big fight infrared by users running their own el. I don't see why so basically infera does not support the engine api so that means that if you use infera post merge as your el. You won't be able to produce a block and to verify blocks that are being produced by the networks. so it would be kind of strictly worse in terms of potential rewards. Obviously it might be lower cost to do that but  it's not something infrared has mentioned to us. They've also done a ton of education towards their users over the past couple months trying to explain to them why people need to run their own el now. Oh yeah okay it seems I misunderstood the question.  What was the Question?

**Micah Zoltu** [13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=833s):  Yeah I believe the question is it is now significantly more expensive to run an ethereum client than it was after regular node operators. It will become much more expensive and the reason for this is twofold when you have to run two clients is more operationally complex but two you need to retain receipt history and I believe block header history and I maybe block body which I don't know on that one whereas previously. You could run like a number of the different clients that allowed you to prune history in order to save space, so you could run it on 150 gigabytes of disk right now. You need like six or seven hundred gigabytes for the I think the smallest node requires six hundred dollars now. Okay okay so there are a number of people who previously could run a node and now cannot run a node and so there's discussion on maybe trying to fix this but there's no ETA on  fixing it. But yeah I personally do suspect that there will be some number of users I have seen people frustrated with the change and some people giving up and running nodes because of this. 

**Tim Beiko** [14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=899s): So I think yeah so short answer is of course if the requirements increase less people will run the nodes and the questions by how much. I think you know client teams are working on ways to like optimise that I know you know the get team and I believe a while back eragon was working on a way to like run you know a beacon client in parallel and I know that the cl teams have worked on ways to  optimise the storage as well. So I suspect over time the overhead of running both is something that will work on minimising but for sure in the meantime if there's more overhead then it means less people might be able to run this and so they might use something or alchemy unfortunately yeah.

**Trent** [15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=944s):  Okay, next one was has a difficulty bomb. Some side effect um so i'm not sure i understand the question but uh basically the difficulty bomb is probably starting to go off right around now um i haven't looked at super closely myself but it's very much in the early stages, so you know there's probably some minimal effect and if I don't know, if it's showing up in block times yet but it might show up and say mining rewards every hundred thousand blocks it increases. So the merge I suspect  is going to happen last. I checked it was something like 40 000 blocks at the current difficulty. So wherever the difficulty bomb is kind of at now it's likely that it won't go more than like one extra period beyond this before we transition to proof of stake, so there is some  minimal effect. It might grow a little bit more  but we're not in a spot where the difficulty bombs impact in the next week or two will make a difference to things.

Okay so there's some discussion in the chat. There's some questions in the chat about basically this history storage and whatnot a question about what's the lightest weight non-validating home node setup. I don't have the exact answer here i don't know if someone
on the call has an answer. Oh I see Pari's joined on the call. Pari I feel like you might have a feel for that. oh okay sorry I've muted you sorry about that .

**Pari** [17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1069s):  Yeah sorry could you just repeat the question again? 

**Trent** [17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1070s):  If you have a 
feeling for what is the lightest weight non-validating node. You can run if you're optimising for this space basically.

**Pari** [18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1081s):   I think either
nethermind and I think netherland and nimble should be a good combination in that scenario. I remember talking to malek about it at some point and I think the difference isn't that much with geth but it is still you're still gonna save a couple gigabytes

**Trant** [18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1099s):  Do you have ballpark numbers or not off the double.

**Pari** [18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1103s):  let me try and find that. I can just post them in chat in a few minutes awesome yeah thanks.

**Trent** [18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1113s):  We had some people also ask about the shadow. The latest shadow board other than saying it went well. Do you have anything to add to Pari. 

**Pari** [18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1124s): Yes I think, yeah so it did go well. The only issue we saw was with one Teku Argon note but that was my mistake. I didn't clean the machine properly earlier so it had some stale data and Argon basically thought it was on the old shadow fork rather than the new one. Whereas the beacon had no thought. It was on a new one and it just was unhealthy. Besides that we're just looking into some mev relay behaviour. Just to make sure that everything is working as expected but that's the only open topic right now I think. Yeah otherwise all clients went through a transition as expected.

**Trent** [19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1176s):  Thank you.

**Trim Beiko** [19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1179s):  Fred has a question: what's the best public dashboard to follow during the merge. So I think unless you're like monitoring your own nodes. The first thing you probably like is a beacon chain that has a bunch of charts. They usually lag a little bit unfortunately but I think that's probably the best public one on the live stream. I suspect people will be sharing their screens and looking at more granular monitoring as well so the live stream we mentioned earlier. We'll probably have some better or like more recent data. And basically I think the first thing you were looking at is like does the network finalise on the other side and that basically tells us you know over two-thirds of the validators agreed on the merge block and the transition and we're coming checking along that's a very low bar for success. I think the second thing we look at is this participation rate, so it's like you know between two thirds and a hundred percent how many validators are still doing all their duties and I think from that you know there's a bunch of other kinds of secondary metrics. We'll start looking at one. I'm particularly curious to see myself as a fee recipient, you know are there cases where we can tell that large validator sets have not or miss set their fee recipient. I think you know from there it  becomes you know it becomes much more cases where like you know the network is coming is going along we haven't lost any throughput and whatnot and it's more about like are there specific operators that that are having issues or do we see you know we might see some issue with a specific client combo and trying to to try and grade those. But yeah beacon chain has some good dashboards that will give you this high level information. If you run monitoring on your node you get a bunch of other kind of health data and just stability data and yeah I think on the livestream we'll be sharing some more stuff as well.

**Trent** [21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1303s):  Do we plan to post subtitles for this meeting later where if yes advise subtitles. I think youtube does the closed captions automatically when we after the live stream is over. I don't know if we do notes for these meetings if we do full transcripts. I don't think we do yeah oh we do just as we do so there'll be a full transcript as well usually the transcripts lag by a couple days. So if you want to get the info before the merge I recommend in this case actually watching the recording because you might get the transcripts like next monday which might be 24 hours or something before the merge any other questions and Pari is posting all of the the size of
the different kinds of themes in the chat right here. Yeah if there's nothing else oh here we go. How many validators do you think will run lbv boost after the merge. I don't know, I know some sticky pools have made commitments to run specific mev instances and so I suspect you know They'll probably be a couple of like the larger chunks of validators that end up running it. But I don't know for all the staking pools I don't have a view and say like what exchanges will do and it's hard to predict what the long tail of home stickers and solo stickers will do as well. I don't know if anyone thinks they have a better estimate. Oh! I seee there's a chris here but I don't know if that's chris from the flashbacks team or  if so please post in the chat and all on youtube.

Okay there's a question about writing a validator note on the raspberry pi. I don't know Pari if you want to answer this. Sorry I muted you again.

**Pari** [24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1459s):  Yeah no problem. Yes, so you can run a validating node on raspberry pi. We have a twitter page theorem on arm. So they  prepare images which have the clients built in them and I think they even have a couple of guides on how you can get validators running on raspberry pi. They have taken part in shadow forks in the past and everything's work quite okay. I think the only thing they recommend is that you don't run too many validators but if you just have a handful it should be fine and they were testing a different board rocks something if I am not wrong. It's supposed to be a lot more powerful overboard compared to raspberry pi and it had some different architecture that allowed you to have better ssds connected to them. I know there would be a lot of advantages to using that one. So talk to them. They should be the best people to help with this. Yeah I see something in chat rock by something like that yeah.

**Paul** [25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1153s):  Yeah it's Paul question. I don't have strong. I guess you know the only strong opinion. I have about these if you're a user. You should try and figure out whether  the chain you're interacting us is safe in a way and like there's many ways you can look at that and there's many things that people forking ethereum can do in order to make things safer and basically you know one of the very obvious ones is just like replay protection if you make a transaction on a chain. You want it  to ideally not be able to be replayed on another network so that you know the transaction. You're only making one transaction when you think you're making one transaction to me personally. That's the very minimal bar of safety and you know some of these chains. These potential forex have not um then this like very basic technical thing so you know my thoughts on it is  none of these forks have released software that's at the very minimum bar of secure for users doesn't mean that they can't do it. Doesn't mean that they're not free to fork the network. But yeah that's my rough feeling so far everything we've seen from them has been very subpar in terms of quality. I personally would not like to trust my funds on any of those chains and unless you're very comfortable with what you're trying to say, make transactions on one chain and you know to say sell to something else. At the risk of potentially getting replayed on the main net might not be worth it. So yeah that's the main thing I would say it's just  you know be sure that the chain you're interacting with is safe and that it doesn't put your funds on the ethereum net at risk by doing so. But you know yeah likeIi said  people are free to fork the network if you want I can try to unmute I've asked the unmute m-con but I think somebody's gonna have to accept

**Mcon 2 Crew speaker ** [28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1693s):  Oh hey we just want to say thank you.

**Paul** [28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1710s):  Thanks a lot This is awesome. Thank you

**Trent** [28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1724s):  Any other questions because otherwise this feels like the highest point at which we can end this.
**Paul** [29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1740s):  So yeah basically we have one finalised.

**Trent** [29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1745s):  I bought yeah so that's usually two by default but if we were in a state where the network was unstable. It might be more than two and yeah so I don't want people to use two as a number but finalisation is the bar that we're looking for. Again though i'll emphasise this is the very minimal bar. You know if things are not finalising that's very bad but even if they are you know if we have eighty percent of the network that's participating. You know then it still means the network is finally moving along but it means we've lost 20 percent of throughput so that's still something we're not going to call it a day at that point. We want to fix that but the network would be stable. So those are two different things so two epochs should happen if we have at least two thirds of clients updated and participating as expected and so that's kind of the very minimal bar means the merge has happened and we're kind of finalising on the network but it could mean that we have up to a third of the network that's not operating correctly and obviously we'd want to figure out what the issue is there and fix it. So you know it could be a broken client. It could be something like you know some major staking provider has an issue or like several of them have an issue so things that. Okay, more questions? okay so yeah yeah so there's a question about um basically block times and how it impacts protocols that might use time that might use this to calculate annual interest rates so the thing is on proof of work. Timestamps are very malleable so sometimes protocols don't use the time to calculate annual interest rates, instead they use the number of blocks. They make an assumption about how many blocks. There's in a year and they kind of go from there, so if we just very naively go from 13 second to 12 seconds it means there's more blocks in a single year. So if you've been using that kind of proxy of  you know a year divided by 13 seconds to count the number of blocks of the year now you probably want to use 12. None of those are like perfect proxies because the 13 seconds you know we have stuff like the difficulty bomb that shows up and it's  only a rough average and then the 12 second we have things validators being offline which could which could cause some slots to be missed. We see this less than one percent of the time right now. So you know if you are using number of blocks as a proxy for time, you should double check those calculations and the thing that's also worth noting is that post merged timestamps are actually a reliable indicator of time. So the time stamps will indicate the time stamps on the execution layer indicate kind of the start time of the slot. So if you just want to straight up use time for your calculation you can do that in a more reliable way post merge. Okay and then there's an article about more details around network finalisation. So okay any particular hack concerns closer to the merge events. so the thing with the merge is basically the execution layer itself doesn't really change much right ? There's one op code that changes. So in terms of smart contracts being hackable. There's not really a ton that you're introducing here. It's not like we're adding some new code and they can be used in the way that was previously unusable and kind of affect the outcome of transactions and that's by design. You don't want the merge to require upgrades from applications so ideally you shouldn't change the behaviour on applications. So I think at that level that's not something we're concerned about. You know I am with regards to stuff like bridges and oracles and what not that kind of feed in to like you know that reports data back to the chain that becomes very much an infrastructure. A great question again where you know oracles should also upgrade their nodes and they should make sure they're on the right chain um but that's something they must do every hard fork. Right?  Yeah so I don't if somebody else has something to share their post in the chat and will unmute you but I don't think there's anything new on like the smart contract hack side. 
Yeah so there's a question about what happens if we don't have two thirds and we're not finalising so you don't have a strong guarantee that the chain you're on wall pre-org has even more so if  yeah your view of the network drops below 50. So if you are say like an exchange or something or someone, even just a user you know who's settling in an off-chain transaction or selling a transaction which has some off-chain implications. You just can't be sure that this won't reorg whereas once once a block or once an epoch gets finalised. All the transactions within that epoch are basically extremely unlikely to ever be reorg and doing so would require burning about a third of the stake at a minimum. So unless you're transacting in amounts that involve more than about four million eth, the cost of reorganic finalised blocks is much greater than whatever you're selling. Okay Pari there's some people who want more clarification on shadow forks on youtube again just more you wanna add.

**Pari** [35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWMYrdC6bg&t=1745s): We're still digging into it. So I'm not particularly sure so we just noticed that there were a couple of Teku
blocks that had missed their proposal because they were connected to a relay and the relay was offline but it had already accepted the bid and that shouldn't have happened so we're just checking us what's happened or what the assumption is that's happened there but we're still figuring that one out. It looks like everyone's behaving as expected though so it could just be that the proposal was delayed or something. I can share some more info once we have it. Anything else? Okay last call I think that's a good spot to wrap up then. Thanks everyone for joining and yeah see you on post marriage ethereum in less than a week thanks everyone.
