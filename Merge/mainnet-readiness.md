Previous docs: [WIP doc](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/consensus_api_design_space), [Interop Edition](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/interop/specification.md)
    * Support execution-layer state sync
    * Support async block insert
    * Consider support for `Consensus <-> Execution` consistency (e.g. recover from crash or bad insert on execution layer)
    * Consider bi-directional communication
    * ...
* [x] Discuss JSON-RPC vs websockets vs restful http
* [x] Migrate to [execution-APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-APIs) or other permanent home, [link](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine)
* [ ] Remove unauthenticated port from specification
* [ ] [BONUS] Test vectors

### Public facing documents

## Testing

### Unit tests

* [ ] Consensus
    * [x] Inherit all prior unit tests and generators
    * [x] Merge specific tests with mocked execution-layer
    * [ ] [IN [PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/tests/core/pyspec/eth2spec/test/bellatrix/fork_choice)] Fork and fork-choice tests across merge boundary
    * [ ] Weak subjectivity checkpoint sync readiness
* [ ] Execution
    * [ ] [IN [PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth/pull/160)] Reuse existing framework for most prior EVM unit tests
    * [ ] [IN [PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/1008)] New `DIFFICULTY` opcode tests

### Integration tests

* [x] Testnet [chaos messages](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/go-ethereum/tree/merge-bad-block-creator)
* [ ] Hive
    * [ ] [IN [PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/496)] Mocked CL for EL engine API unit testing
    * [ ] [IN [PROGRESS](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/pull/495)] CL+EL integration ests with all client combos
* [ ] Shadow fork Goerli on a daily or weekly basis to continuously test live transition and TX replays 
* [x] [BONUS] Additional simulation testing -- e.g. kurtosis, antithesis, etc
    * [x] [Kurtosis Merge Module](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-merge-kurtosis-module)

### Stress tests

* [ ] Single client load/metrics
* [ ] Network load testing 
  * [ ] Larger blocks
  * [ ] Shorter slot times
  * [ ] Large execution state (shadow-forking mainnet)

### Fuzzing

* [x] [Fuzz engine API](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/merge-fuzz)
* [ ] Beacon-fuzz applied to merge ready consensus clients
* [ ] Existing EVM fuzzing infra applied to merge ready execution engines

## Testnets

* [X] Short-lived devnets without transition process
* [X] Short-lived devnets *with* transition process
* [x] Long-lived devnets [link](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/)
* [ ] Fork public testnets

## R&D

Most research related to the merge has been completed. This section lists topics which are either tangentially related, or nice-to-haves, and still require R&D work.

* [x] Transition process analysis
    * [x] Evaluate precision of TD computation on historic data
        * https://ethresear.ch/t/using-total-difficulty-threshold-for-hardfork-anchor-what-could-go-wrong/10357
* [x] Execution-layer sync
    * [x] Historic block sync (reverse header then forward body)
    * [x] Historic state sync (optimistic beacon block transition provides head data for EL sync)
    * [x] Sync during transition period (forward sync to PoW TTD, reverse sync past TTD)
* [x] Discovery [is there actually anything to do here?]
* [x] [In research, not to be included merge] Execution-layer proof of custody
* [ ] Disaster recovery if invalid chain finalized
  * [x] EL will perform re-orgs beyond finality but at a potential high sync cost
  * [x] [WIP] Client multiplexers ([link](https://github.com/karalabe/minority), note: doesn't help with DR, but can potentially prevent invalid chains being finalized)
* [ ] Further threat analysis
    * [ ] Miner attacks
    * [ ] Resource exhaustion post-merge
* [x] Fee Market behavior changes (missed slots impact)
    * [EIP-4396](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4396) proposed
